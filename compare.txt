Energy problem has become a major challenge in twenty-first century and countries around the world are looking for solutions. Development of renewable energy is one of the important means to solve the energy crisis. Renewable energy data has multi-attribute characteristics. And across different areas many studies use data mining from renewable energy data to get viable rule induction, thereby achieving a long-term energy planning. For multi-attribute problems and rule induction solution, rough set is an appropriate method. Additionally, past studies for big data dynamic database tend to focus on incremental manner, but neglect decrement situation. This study will entail the perspective of big data to explore rough set rule induction with decrement operation assessment program used in the promotion of renewable energy sources. The study also presents case evidence.
key word: rough set, big data, renewable energy, decrement algorithms
